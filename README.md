# Trueman
An account and device enrollment portal for new Microsoft M365 users

## Phase 1
The first phase of the project should provide a blazor web app allowing an AAD user to sign in with the new SMS Sign In (this should work 'out of the box', no extra code should be needed based on Microsoft auth code). With the given login, the app provides a wizard like UI to map a user to pre-enrolled Autopilot devices and allow the user to enroll it's device and set the AAD users password.  
  
A mockup is available in docs/trueman-phase-one.pdf. The sources of this mockup are also available in docs, you may download https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ (or try their cloud interface). 30 day trial should be enough.
